Shift Design with Answer Set Programming and Bus Driver Scheduling Problem

Shift Design with Answer Set Programming:
Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a powerful declarative programming
paradigm that has been successfully applied to many different domains. Recently,
ASP has also proved successful for hard optimization problems like course
timetabling. In this paper, we approach another important task, namely, the shift
design problem, aiming at an alignment of a minimum number of shifts in order
to meet required numbers of employees (which typically vary for dierent time
periods) in such a way that over- and understanding is minimized. We provide an
ASP encoding of the shift design problem, which, to the best of our knowledge,
has not been addressed by ASP yet. Our experimental results demonstrate that
ASP is capable of improving the best known solutions to some benchmark problems.
Other instances remain challenging and make the shift design problem an
interesting benchmark for solving methods based on ASP.

Bus Scheduling Problem:
Bus driver scheduling can be formulated as a set paritioning problem. The problem consists of a given set of tasks (pieces of work) to cover and a large set of possible shifts, where each shift covers a subset of the tasks and has an associated cost.The aim is to select a subset of possible shifts that covers each piece of work once and only once: this is called a partition. Further, In the driver scheduling the main aim is to reduce the number of shifts used in the solution partition and the total cost of the partition is secondary. The cost of each shift the same. This means that the goal is to minimize the number of shifts. There are 12 such instances provided.
